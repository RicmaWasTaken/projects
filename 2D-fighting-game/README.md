This is a repository hosting the multiple versions of my browser-based, 2D fighting game that started out as a joke but evolved into my end-of-year academic project. 
It consists of two characters (Player VS CPU) fighting each other by launhcing different types of projectiles. 
Each game can last up to 30secs, after which the player loses the game if he failed to beat the CPU. 
Each character has its own lifebar. 
The game is currently running on JS, but I am planning to expand the back-end PHP side to allow the player to cycle through multiple arenas and characters. 

Current version : V3
