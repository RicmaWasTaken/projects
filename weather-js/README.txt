Weather app for browsers with a simple html, css and js basis. 
It's based on the free OpenWeather API, so you must register on their website and add your own API key into the JS file
Do keep in mind that this app uses JavaScript's fetch() function on the client side, so your API key will be visible to the client 
The images are also fetched from OpenWeather's asset folder 
Feel free to modify this code at will
